Tabula gratulatoria
===================

This is a simple Django database app for listing people, their address and how
many books they want to buy and what they want to be credited with in the book.

It is mostly just using everything Django gives you for free.  It's only use
and claim-to-exist is to help my girlfriend use something a bit more productive
than a spreadsheet since she's well over 3000 entries now.

I don't expect this to be useful to anyone, but put it because someone told me
why not just put up stuff you use yourself.  So here it is.


It can do these things:

  - Has a view for adding new people (this will be sent by email, since my
    girlfriend wants full manual control)
  - Has two few handy functions in the admin to export as CSV
  - Has some CSV importers for external data

It'll also get a duplicate checker at one point.

I meant to make it also send the emails and give everyone their own link to
change their info, but people prefer to do it the more manual way ;)
